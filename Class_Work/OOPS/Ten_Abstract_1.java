//An abstract method is a method without a body (implementation). It is only declared in a parent class but must be implemented in child classes.
//
//üìå Key Rules of Abstract Methods

//1Ô∏è Declared using abstract keyword
//2Ô∏è Cannot have a body (no {})
//3Ô∏è Must be inside an abstract class
//4Ô∏è Child class must override it (or become abstract itself)



//If we have atleast one abstract method , then the whole class will become an abstract class


//If an abstract class has only abstract methods, it behaves like an interface but still remains an abstract class.


//If a class implements an abstract class then it has to implement all the abstract methods that are present. Example : Car
